1. This project are using **NODE.JS** version `18.6.0` so if you don't have that version download it
2. You should install required modules before running app by `npm i` command
3. Use `run.bat` file in your **CMD** and it will do every things you need to use dev mode
4. Website will take some time in `Loading...` mode because **server** need some time to start in the dev mode
